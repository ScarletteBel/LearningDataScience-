# LearningBigDataAnalysis 
This repository has all the small projects that involve all the knowledge and improvement that I have got in the last year, involving the different topics, analysis, visualization tools, and different techniques, that the data analysis requires, that's why there is a table of content and a small description of each folder. 



### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
##### This folder has micro-projects of the beginning of machine learning which is part of AI, involving supervised machine learning working with continuous data and        categorical data for making predictions.


### NaturalLanguageProcessing (NLP)
##### This is a section where NLP is implemented, and the reading and analyzing of recorded text or voice is analyzed as a subfield of AI; from the most basic base methods to the prediction of text classifications.


### Python 
##### This folder has basic exercises where python's logic was executed and described, understanding data structures and commands. Some libraries are used in this file; nevertheless, python is used for executing everything in the rest of the files in this repository, where more python tools were implemented.


### SQL 
##### The amazing SQL... in this file many SQL queries were executed. It has different sections, from creating empty tables, data types definitions, and linking databases with primaries and foreign keys, to execution of advanced SQL queries to outstand the desired data with one or more databases. Queries were initially run in SQL server, MySQL.


### Statistics 
##### Statistic concepts are described and applied in this file, using different python libraries (seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy...) for applying this field of maths and the visualizations which can not be missed for a good understanding of the data.
